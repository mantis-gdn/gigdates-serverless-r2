Their music is available on Bandcamp, and they actively engage with fans through social media platforms.",
      "interview": "<p>When So Many Dangers took the stage at AS220, it marked a pivotal moment for a band whose journey has been anything but unconventional. From a Craigslist ad for a drummer to coaxing a prog-metal guitarist into joining a ska band, So Many Dangers is the product of eclectic influences and relentless determination. Blending reggae, ska, punk, and progressive metal into a self-described genre of 'Progressive Post Skacore,' their sound is as dynamic and unpredictable as their formation story. Tonight, they’re here to bring high energy and, in their own words, 'something a little unexpected' to the crowd, making it clear that So Many Dangers is ready to break new ground in 2025 and beyond.</p><p><strong>Q: How did So Many Dangers come together?</strong></p><p>A: I found the drummer on Craigslist and then we just built it up over the course of two years. Kyria the singer was the third person, then Jim the trombonist. We tried out, like seven bass players before we found Jessie, and then I almost immediately found Colby looking for people to play prog metal with but I talked him into joining my ska band.</p><p><strong>Q: What’s the story behind the name?</strong></p><p>A: The name is a quote I found in a book. It’s by an Australian Aboriginal artist who was explaining all the dangers of life in the bush. The name sounds cool.</p><p><strong>Q: How would you describe your sound in one or two sentences?</strong></p><p>A: I'm calling the genre Progressive Post Skacore. That's a little tongue in cheek but It’s like, if Sublime listened to Dream Theater too.</p><p><strong>Q: What bands or genres influence your music?</strong></p><p>A: I grew up listening to reggae and early ska music and punk and then was a huge Sublime fanboy through high school. I discovered metal in college and got into super techy prog metal. So, all of those things kind of come together. Rx Bandits is a big influence, a bunch of the modern metal 'djent' bands are big influences.</p><p><strong>Q: What’s the energy like at a So Many Dangers show?</strong></p><p>A: As high energy as we can do it.</p><p><strong>Q: Do you have a favorite live performance memory?</strong></p><p>A: Oh yeah. One of my earliest memories of playing music was for a grade school concert. I played the hand bells. It changed my life. I am sure we sounded like absolute shit, but it was a memory that stuck with me. It was the first time I felt the chills playing music and the thrill of performing live.</p><p><strong>Q: What should people expect from your set tonight at AS220?</strong></p><p>A: Hopefully something a little unexpected.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you feel about opening the show tonight?</strong></p><p>A: I am stoked. We are just getting started getting our name out there.</p><p><strong>Q: What’s next for the band—any recordings, tours, or projects in the works?</strong></p><p>A: Studio recordings are a priority for 2025. We're just looking for the right studio who gets what we're trying to do.</p><p><strong>Q: Where do you see So Many Dangers in the next year?</strong></p><p>A: Playing bigger stages. I think we have something special, and I want people to hear it.</p><p><strong>Q: Where can people find your music or follow you online?</strong></p><p>A: Instagram and Facebook. Hopefully on streaming platforms by the end of 2025.</p><p><strong>Q: Anything else you’d like to share with your fans or new listeners?</strong></p><p>A: Keep Ska Weird.</p>",
